	<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
</div>
<div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto pb-28">
	<p class="pt-28">
		Effective date: Mar 22, 2023
		<br /><br />
		These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern
		your relationship with footape.com website (the "Service").
		<br /><br />
		Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the Service.
		<br /><br />
		Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these
		Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
		<br /><br />
		By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any
		part of the terms then you may not access the Service.
	</p>
	<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
	<p>
		Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be
		billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set
		either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when
		purchasing a Subscription.
		<br /><br />
		At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same
		conditions unless you cancel it or Footape cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either
		through your online account management page or by contacting Footape support.
		<br /><br />
		A valid payment method, including credit or debit card, is required to process the payment for your
		Subscription. You shall provide Footape with accurate and complete billing information including
		full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By
		submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Footape to charge all Subscription
		fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
		<br /><br />
		Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Footape will issue an electronic invoice indicating
		that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding
		to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
	</p>
	<h2>Free Trial</h2>
	<p>
		Footape may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period
		of time ("Free Trial").
		<br /><br />
		You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.
		<br /><br />
		If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged
		by Footape until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you
		cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for
		the type of Subscription you have selected.
		<br /><br />
		At any time and without notice, Footape reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions
		of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
	</p>
	<h2>Fee Changes</h2>
	<p>
		Footape, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the
		Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current
		Billing Cycle.
		<br /><br />
		Footape will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give
		you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
		<br /><br />
		Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes
		your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
	</p>
	<h2>Refunds</h2>
	<p>
		Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Footape on a case-by-case basis
		and granted in sole discretion of Footape.
	</p>
